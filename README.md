# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

This challenge involves creating a  web application that allows coding boot camp students to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals and compare their scores to their peers.

## Usage

The user can initiate the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button. This will start the timer and present the user with the first question.

Each question is presented one at a time, and the user can select one answer from a list of options.

If the user selects the incorrect answer, the quiz will subtract time from the timer.

Once the user has answered all the questions or the timer has reached 0, the quiz will end. The user's score will be displayed, and the user can enter their initials to save their score.
